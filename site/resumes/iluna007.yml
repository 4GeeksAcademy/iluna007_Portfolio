        IAAC’s Master in Advanced Architecture (1 or 2-year program) revolutionises current architectural approaches. 
        By training professionals to take informed, creative and innovative actions, the program encourages them to 
        become changemakers and pioneers in the arena of architecture and the built environment. Based on a “Learning by Doing” 
        and a “Design by Research” methodologies the Master in Advanced Architecture nurtures critical thinking, 
        ingenuity and the materialisation of ideas.
        
        Following a multidisciplinary and multiscalar approach, the programme presents an unique academic structure, 
        where students can create their own customised study agenda, according to their interests and their future 
        career aspirations. Students can choose from a selection of different courses from technologies, to approaches 
        and development methodologies allowing them to build meaningful proposals to face the challenges of architecture today.
